* First off you must be logged in to use the majority of this web app, so click sign in or sign up.
* The 'Flixter' button on the top left will bring you to the home page.
* The 'See All Courses' tab on the top left and the 'Battle' button on the center of the page will show you the list of all the courses that are available.
'My Dashboard' located at the bottom and the top right of the screen will show you a summary of all the courses that are being learned and taught.
* At the bottom of the screen 'Teach a Course will pop up a window allowing you to create a course where you will pick a title, write a little description, and choose the cost(you can't leave the cost blank, but you can put 0). Next attach an image if you wish then click create.
* Once a Course is created you then can add sections where you will pick a title
* Under a section you can create lessons. Click create lesson, choose a title, if you want you can add a subtitle, and attach a video if you choose. Then click 'Add the Lesson' button to finish creating the lesson.
* Once a course is created with sections and lessons, if you click 'See All Courses' or 'Battle' then click 'More Details' next to the course name you can add more sections and lessons if you want to by clicking the red 'Administer' button.
'See All Courses' and 'Battle' buttons will allow you to view the courses as well. You must be enrolled in the course to actually view the content under a course, so make sure to hit the enroll button and add your fake credit card number. Use "4242" as the card number, choose any expiration/CVC, leave the remember me box uncheked, and hit the blue button below. You will then be enrolled and will be able to freely browse the content of the course.
